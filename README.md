# SMVE (Statistical Methods of Experiment Evaluation)
A student will learn the basics of modern probability and statistics. He will understand the relationship between the theory of probability and statistics. He will learn to understand the basic concepts of mathematical statistics and to use its methods. The student will get an overview of one- and multi-dimensional baseline probability distributions, various approaches of estimate constructing and hypothesis testing. After completing the course, he will be able to analyze and process real statistical datasets from technical practice.
